# Pink-Math
Making Math prettier.

Math seems to be a black and white world, which is not neccessarily true - it can be also very creative and fun.
Therefore I have decided to create the calculator that can switch different shades of pink and create a nice vibe for all girls and ladies doing their homework, budget calculations or just playing with numbers for the little ones.

1# I started coding this calculator by creating a proper html structure:
  - <input> elements seemed to be the most efficient for creating calculator fields in combination with "display.value" to set up proper content of the fields
  - the calculation itself is provided by "eval" function that is initiated when user clicks on equal operator "="

2# Then I added the color theme via css file"
  
- here I used with ":root" and "var(--)" to be able to change colors easily later on

3# In the end I added javascript in order to create a basic toggler for color switching - by using "onclick" function in combination with "classlist" 

This is overall just a first prototype, minimum viable product that I would further work on to provide more color options, themes, responsiveness etc.
