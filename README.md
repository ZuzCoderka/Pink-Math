# Pink-Math
Making Math prettier.

Math seems to be a black and white world, which is not neccessarily true - it can be also very creative and fun.
Therefore I have decided to create the calculator that can switch different shades of pink and create a nice vibe for all girls and ladies doing their calculations.

I looked for the inspiration on the internet and built my code around it: 

- firstly handling the <input> elements to provide basic structure
- secondly adding colors via css file
- thirdly adding javascript in order to create a basic toggler for color switching

This is overall just a first prototype, minimum viable product that I would further work on to provide more color options, themes etc.

Thank you in advance for your feedback :)
